# qr-img-generator

  <h2>About this Project:</h2>
    <p>This is an image-based QR-code generator that allows a user to upload an image, crop, generate and edit a qr-code.  Florida Memory frequently utilizes QR codes for outreach and various
            practical applications. As an archive renowned for its extensive photo
            collection, we sought the capability to embed QR codes directly into our
            photos. During our search, we discovered an open-source called <a href="https://github.com/kciter/qart.js?tab=readme-ov-file">QART</a>
            , which enables the generation of image-based codes.
            We decided to enhance and develop it into a
            more user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of generating,
            editing, and downloading codes on the fly. In addition, we used <a href="">Cropper.js</a> to crop the images.
